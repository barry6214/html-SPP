        <p>This is the legendary, hand made supplement that allows you too train and race at a higher level for a longer period of time by delaying fatigue.
            The ingredients have been tweaked and refined over a period of over 20 years to incorporate the latest research on athletic performance and endurance. The latest tweak has added Taurine.
            Taurine is an amino acid that has a lot of recent buzz due to its apparent benefit of facilitating fat burning and is actively being researched now 
            in the longevity community. It is one of the active ingredients in Red Bull. Horo regularly runs a weekly 10 mile tempo run using SPP's alone with no pre or post nutrition.
    

        </p>

        <p>
            Although SPP's have been used for years by many local athletes, they have never been available commercially. Because they are literally hand made and personally
            formulated and encapsulated by Horo, a very limited amount is available at any time.
